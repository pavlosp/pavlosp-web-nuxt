Nice to e-meet you. I am a **management and strategy consultant** at 
**[Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com)**, based in London.

My consulting expertise focuses on **tech & digital strategy development and execution, 
in order to drive business value**. 

I have more-or-less 15 years of experience, mainly in **technology, digital and banking** industries.

I have also served as **Head of Insights (data-driven strategy) at [DRIVETRIBE](https://drivetribe.com)**,
the digital home of motoring.

Outside my day-job, I lead the
**[Pride@BCG](https://www.bcg.com/en-gb/about/about-bcg/pride-at-bcg.aspx)**
network in the UK; I feel passionate about driving equality in the
workplace and society at large. I devote time to **LGBT+ research & publications** outside client work.

Apart from my passion for **technology and science**, I enjoy **travelling, staying fit, design, art and architecture.** 
I love **visual storytelling through photography (digital and film) and videography** (from 8/16mm to digital).
